# MyWork
This is the ATTS Code Assignment.
The database connection is as following: Data Source=VALLY; Database = ATTSAssignment.
This was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and SQL Server Management Studio 2012. I did not have Visual Studio 2013 on my laptop
as per the initial specifications.
The file Create account table.sql creates the table required in the database.
The file to be imported has to be a comma delimited csv file.
